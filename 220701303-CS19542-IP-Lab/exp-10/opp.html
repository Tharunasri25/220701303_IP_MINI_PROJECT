                    <p class="text-info">Computer Science and Engineering graduates are the pillars of the current and emerging information era. Opportunities include 
                        pursuing Master of Science Programs in reputed Universities of U.S. and taking up research assignments in Hardware, System Software, Computer 
                        Engineering, Multimedia, Networking and Communication areas.<br><br>
        
                        Job opportunities are ever increasing and are varied in nature. System study, analysis, Design and Programming are the inherent phases in
                        Application Development and each one of them provides enormous potential to the Computer Science and engineering graduates to shape themselves 
                        in their career. Hi-end profiles include Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Graphic Solutions and Simulations.<br><br>
        
                        This degree program prepares students for Advanced, Technical Computer Systems Design and Development Work. It includes the study of the
                        Database Design, Data Communication, Procedural and Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems Design, Algorithm Development and
                        Applications of Artificial Intelligence. The curriculum includes basic course work in Electronics Technology and the Theory of Programming
                        Languages. Students focus on developing computer-based solutions involving hardware and software components and integration. Graduates are 
                        qualified to work in a range of positions, from entry-level computer scientists and system engineers to project managers leading advanced 
                        applications of computer science to real-world problems. The department has since broadened its research strengths.</p>
